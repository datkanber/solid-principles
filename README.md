# SOLID Principles in C#

This repository provides examples of **SOLID Principles** implemented in C#. Each principle is demonstrated with **"Good"** and **"Bad"** examples to illustrate the correct and incorrect ways of applying these principles in software design.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

- To understand the **SOLID Principles** and their importance in software development.
- To compare "Good" and "Bad" implementations of each principle.
- To improve code maintainability, scalability, and readability.

## ðŸ“š SOLID Principles Overview

1. **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
   A class should have one and only one reason to change.

2. **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**  
   Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

3. **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**  
   Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the functionality.

4. **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**  
   A client should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.

5. **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**  
   High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
